    name: "Shishito Pepper",
    shortDescription: "",
    description:
      "Compact, bushy plants produce an abundance of 3.5-4\"\" wrinkled fruits over an extended period. When eaten in the green stage, as is traditional in Japan, peppers are incredibly crunchy with just a hint of heat. When red, the fruits are sweet and slightly hotter but not as crunchy. Perfect for frying, this Japanese heirloom's fruits are usually mild, but an occasional pepper (about one in 10) is hot. Kitazawa Seed Company played an instrumental role in introducing 'Shishito' to the United States seed trade; Seed Savers Exchange acquired the variety in the 1980s from the Urban Farmerseed company of Convent Station, N.J.",
